# Tube-clone
A simple YouTube clone built using HTML and CSS. This project replicates the UI of YouTube, featuring a responsive layout, video thumbnails, a navigation bar, and a clean design. No JavaScript is usedâ€”purely HTML and CSS for structure and styling. Ideal for beginners learning front-end development and UI design.
